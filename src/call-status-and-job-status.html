        <p>This article assumes you:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a href="/developer-registration/">Have an API developer account.</a>

            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            After we send the fax we are going to query the API for the status.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is a PHP Curl request to the <strong>Fax_GetFaxDescriptionsUsingIds</strong> API function. We are passing in the standard account information as well as a nested array of the <strong>FaxIds1</strong> field which is the job id we got back from our <strong>Fax_SendFax</strong> call.
        </p>

        <div>
            <pre><code>
&lt;?php

$curl = curl_init()

curl_setopt_array($curl, array(
  CURLOPT_URL => "https://api2.westfax.com/REST/Fax_GetFaxDescriptionsUsingIds/json",
  CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,

  CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => array(
    "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
  ),

$response = curl_exec($curl);

curl_close($curl);

            Here is the result. Notice the output is broken down into two calls in the <strong>FaxCallInfoList</strong>. You have the Individual <strong>CallId</strong> for each call in the job and the individual status. Here it is <strong>Waiting to dial</strong>. This means we just received the fax and it’s in the pre-processing phase where it is converted to TIFF and being prepared for faxing. Also, note the <strong>Id</strong> field on the main <strong>Result</strong> object. That is the JobID and the Status is currently <strong>Submitted</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that some time has passed let’s run the call again. This result below is the same job but it is now <strong>Complete</strong>. You will see one of the jobs is marked as “<strong>Sent</strong>” and the other one is “<strong>Failed</strong>” and the overall job has the Status of “Complete“. You need to look at the <strong>Result</strong> of the <strong>FaxCallInfoList</strong> to determine the true status of a fax job. Complete just means that we are done with this fax. <u>It does not mean success</u>. You will want to either resend the fax to the failed call or handle it manually by figuring out what is wrong with the number and updating it.

            <strong>In summary:</strong>

            <p>
                The job <strong>Status</strong> is representative of whether we are still processing a fax job. The individual Result code on the FaxCallInfoList is the authoritative location for the status. <strong>Complete</strong> means that we are done and will not work on the calls anymore and it is final.
            </p>

            <p>
                This confuses some using the API and usually results in 2 kinds of mistakes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The developer sends multiple calls per job, and does not realize that there is a job <strong>Result</strong>, AND a call <strong>Status</strong>. The developer interprets the job <strong>Status</strong> as the final result, and therefore does not get the real result of the job.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The developer ignores the job result and uses the call result that is retrieved and assumes that the result is the final result. Unless the job Status is marked as <strong>Complete</strong> we are still processing the calls. One should wait for <strong>Status</strong> = <strong>Complete</strong> before you read the individual Result.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                WestFax can also customize your retry strategy. We typically retry 5 times before failing. If you wish to have us only try once and then fail let us know and we can adjust your retry settings.
            </p>
