                    <span class="question">What is HIPAA?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is United States legislation that provides data privacy and security rules for safeguarding medical information.</span>

                    <span class="question">What is a HIPAA compliant fax?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">HIPAA compliant fax is used by medical professionals and organizations as a highly secure way of sending and receiving private patient information, which is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. HIPAA requires that appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards be used to protect the “protected health information” (PHI) of patients. Cloud-based fax provides a means for sending and receiving such information, provided that the right security measures are in place to prevent disclosure of PHI.  Such measures include high-level encryption; hosting in data centers with 24x7 security, video surveillance, and access control; audit logs; and more.</span>

                    <span class="question">Are online fax services HIPAA compliant?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">Some fax services are HIPAA compliant, while others are not.  Even those that claim to be HIPAA compliant vary considerably in the degree to which they safeguard protected health information (PHI).  Health care providers and other organizations should <a href="https://westfax.com/is-your-fax-hipaa-compliant/" target="_blank">look for fax services</a> that use industry-standard security and encryption, security-certified data centers, and who work with HIPAA covered organizations on a regular basis. Fax providers must also be willing to sign a "<a href="https://westfax.com/what-is-a-baa/" target="_blank">business associate agreement</a>” that meets your organization’s specific needs.</span>

                    <span class="question">Is it safe to fax confidential information?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">Today’s fax technology offers a high level of security and safety, especially when it is offered through a vendor who works with healthcare organizations that must adhere to HIPAA regulations. Healthcare providers, banks, and government offices continue to use fax routinely.  Using a <a href="https://westfax.com/hipaa_details/">secure cloud-based fax service</a>, users can send and receive documents safely, from a desktop computer or mobile phone; and they can access document history and confirmations through a secure online portal.</span>

                    <span class="question">Can I send a fax from my Gmail?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">It’s easy to send a fax using Gmail. Click on the “compose” button to start a new e-mail. In the “To” address field, enter the fax number, followed by “@westfax.com”.  Simply attach a document or image file to the e-mail, and send it.  WestFax will identify it as a fax from your account (based on the Gmail address that you are using to send it), and it will be sent as an outbound fax from your account.</span>

                    <span class="question">Can I send a fax from Word?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">There are several different ways to send a fax from Microsoft Word. The simplest method is to use the WestFax print driver, which emulates a printer on your computer.  By printing the Word file to the WestFax driver and adding your recipient’s fax number, WestFax will automatically route the printing of the Word document to your recipient’s fax machine. WestFax also makes it easy to send word documents as faxes, simply by attaching them to an e-mail or uploading them to the WestFax portal.

                    <span class="question">Is Fax safer than email?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">There are several reasons why fax is safer than e-mail. First, hacking a fax is difficult and very inefficient, so hackers tend to concentrate on easier targets. Second, it is impossible to embed a virus within a fax, so a fax cannot be used to infect your computer with malware, compromising the security of your system and potentially infecting other users.</span>

                    <span class="question">What is always required when you are sending a fax?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">We recommend always including a cover page with your fax. In the case of HIPAA covered organizations, we strongly recommend using a <a href="https://westfax.com/fax-confidentiality-statements/" target="_blank">HIPAA-specific cover page with a confidentiality statement</a>.  WestFax makes it easy to send a fax through our secure online portal, by sending the fax as an e-mail attachment (as a PDF, Word file, or image), or using the WestFax Print to Fax driver.
