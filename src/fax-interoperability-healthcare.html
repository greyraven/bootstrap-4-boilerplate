            From its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax">analog origins in the sixties</a> to the infinitely
            scalable Digital Cloud Fax platforms today that can
            send/receive/process and manage millions of faxes; <strong>Fax has never been as robust and
                powerful</strong>. The future of
            Fax and its role in healthcare has been a topic of much discussion but with the vision of an all-digital
            healthcare system still evolving, fax is seeing its architecture evolve to meet the challenges of complete
            interoperability.

        <strong>
            It’s not about paper waste anymore.
        </strong>

        <p>The fax industry wants you to throw away recycle your fax machines and go digital. The fax industry gains
            nothing from you using paper; however, paper fax, as well as paper medical records, will always be around.
            The advantages of fax (contractually binding, receipt of transmission, HIPAA compliance, etc.) are the same
            if the fax is paper or digital.</p>

        <strong>
            Fax offers 100% Interoperability today.
        </strong>

        <p>
            Digital faxing can be integrated from <span class="text-dark">start to finish</span> in the healthcare
            document lifecycle. From medical
            records in an EMR system being digitally faxed to another office (that utilize cloud fax), where those
            records are put through powerful OCR engines, routed and converted to <a
                href="https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data.html">Structured Data</a>
            which can then be
            consumed with the new medical interoperability standards such as <a
                href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html">FHIR, HL7</a> and <a
                href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html">Direct</a>. What is structured
            data? Basically, it’s data that has an identifiable and repetitive format. HL7 uses a delimited data
            structure, and FHIR messages can use JSON or XML. It’s basically text formatted to be easily readable and
            processable by machines efficiently.

        <p>
            Interoperability is a big buzzword in healthcare and it may seem straightforward. The path to it is less
            clear. Going all digital will require a massive effort by all parties involved, including fax. We have seen
            the evolutions of email and how data is managed in the cloud. There is no reason to believe that fax will
            not evolve as well. Everything in the cloud is a great idea but it’s just an idea. The reality is somewhere
            in the middle. We are getting there but a vast majority of medical records are paper, and document
            conversion is a slow ongoing process. Fax will assist in this effort with digital cloud faxing.
        </p>

        <strong>
            Working toward the same goals.
        </strong>

        <p>
            In conclusion, the future is bright regarding digitizing healthcare records. There will come a day when all
            health records are digital but that future will not materialize if we <span>don’t take a measured and
                thoughtful approach to the process</span class="text-dark">. Going from paper to digital is just the
            first step, not the finale goal. <u>Fax has never been more capable and powerful than it is today</u>. Healthcare
            and organizations working to modernize healthcare will be well <span class="text-dark">served to
                harness</span> that power and avoid the knee-jerk “Axe the Fax” memes which malign a technology that has been a stalwart partner for decades.
