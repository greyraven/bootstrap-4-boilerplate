            Moving your fax number over to cloud fax is usually a straightforward process. It's a little bit of paperwork and if done correctly is fast and easy. Sometimes things don't always go as planned and your port request can be delayed or even worse, rejected! In this post we'll show you the eight most common reasons a port request is rejected or delayed.

        <h3>
          Here are the eight reasons your port order could be rejected (or delayed):
        </h3>
        <!--LIST-->
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Address Mismatch</strong><br>If the address you submitted on the porting order does not match the address on the losing carrier’s Customer Service Record (CSR), you’re going to see a rejection. The losing carriers usually require the Service Address (not always the same as the billing address) for the fax numbers being ported over, so you will need to make sure the correct address is being used. 

                <br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Authorized Name is incorrect</strong><br>Occuring when the authorized name of the person who signs the Letter of Authorization (LOA) for the fax number port order does not match what the losing carrier has in their system. This can happen inadvertently if someone leaves an organization and doesn’t change the records with their carrier to name a new authorized person on the account.

                <br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Incorrect Business Name</strong><br>The business name must match what the losing carrier has on file for the numbers you are porting. Why does this usually happen? Spelling. Like doing your taxes you must ensure the business name is <strong>EXACTLY</strong> the same and you will need to ensure that the business name you submit on the port request form is exactly the same. "Tom's Bass Shop, LLC" is not the same as "Tom's Bass Shop". 

              <br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Missing / Incorrect Account Number</strong><br>Some carriers use the account number as another data point to verify a port order request. If the account number does not match up with what they have on file, your port will be rejected. The account number is often found on the customers bill, and sometimes on the CSR.

              <br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Incorrect BTN (Billing Telephone Number)</strong><br>The Billing Telephone Number (BTN) is the main telephone number on a customer’s account, and it’s a critical element for validating port order requests. If the BTN does not match what the losing carrier has in their records, they will reject the request. 

              <br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Incorrect Passcode/Pin</strong><br>Some carriers use PIN/passcodes to authenticate a port request. This is similar to how your debit card has a PIN code that must match in order to access your account at an ATM. The PIN must be provided on the port request, and it must match what the other carrier has on file.

              <br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Pending/Active Orders</strong><br>If there are any active orders on the account that you’re porting numbers from, carriers will reject a new port order with an error saying “pending orders”. These “pending orders” can include things like a recent feature add or disconnect, address change, authorized name change, etc.

              <br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Delinquent Bill</strong><br>If you owe your carrier a substantial amount of money or are past due on your bill there have been instances where a carrier could delay and/or reject an outbound porting request. It is not as common but it does happen.<br><br></li>

        </ol>
