            Most people aren’t aware of it, but the humble fax continues to play a significant role in business,
            healthcare, and government institutions. Today’s fax technology has matured considerably, though. Users can
            send and receive documents securely, from a desktop computer or mobile phone; and they can access document
            history and confirmations through a secure online portal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Banks, healthcare providers needing HIPAA compliance, and government offices continue to use fax routinely.
            Nearly every member of Congress has an inbound fax number so that constituents can send them messages. A
            foundational rule of marketing says that you should make it easy for customers to communicate with you; so
            it only makes sense to add electronic fax to your business communication toolbox.

            Let’s look at a few of the ways <a href="https://westfax.com/">WestFax</a> makes the process simple and
            painless.

                Fax to Email
            </h2>

                <img width="300px" class="ml-2 mb-1 float-right img-fluid" src="/img/fax-to-email-example.png"

                <p>
                    With fax to e-mail, you don’t even need to be signed in to the web portal. Sending a fax is as
                    simple as attaching a document or image file to an e-mail, and addressing that e-mail using the
                    phone number that the recipient has provided to you. To send a fax to (888) 555-1212, for example,
                    simply send the document as an attachment to 8885551212@westfax.com. WestFax will automatically
                    identify it as a fax from your account (based on the e-mail address that you are using to send it),
                    and it will be sent as an outbound fax from your account.

                Print To Fax
            </h2>
            <p>
                A third method is to print directly to fax. <a href="/print-to-fax/">WestFax provides a print
                    driver</a> for Windows that installs in less than a minute. When you print a document, the WestFax
                print driver shows up as another printer available to your computer. Simply choose WestFax as your
                printer, add a phone number, and click “Send Fax”.

            <h2 class="text-dark">
                Using the WestFax API
            </h2>
            <p>
                For software developers, or for companies using customizable enterprise applications, <a
                    href="/how-to-add-the-westfax-api-into-your-enterprise-application/">WestFax provides an
                    application programming interface</a> (<abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>).
                Using the API, a software developer can add some simple, straightforward code that will enable fax
                functionality to be embedded directly into the software you use every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine, for example, that you use a customizable software package to send customer invoices and track
                receivables. Some of your largest customers routinely call to ask for a monthly statement via fax. By
                adding a “Fax Statement” button to the customer screen, you can reduce the process of faxing a statement
                to a single mouse-click. With a small amount of programming, a developer can retrieve a fax number from
                the customer record, run a customer statement report, and pass it to the WestFax API. The API does the
                rest, sending the document along using secure electronic fax technology and delivering it to your
                customer.

                WestFax Even Manages Your Paper Trail
            </h2>
            <p>One of the nice benefits of using WestFax is that you have a permanent record of all of your inbound and
                outbound faxes, easily accessible through the web portal. If a recipient claims that they never received
                your fax, you can easily go back to the portal and verify that date and time that it was sent, and
                confirm that it was received. Inbound faxes, too, are available to view, print, and download. You can
                forward a fax that you have sent or received, or even e-mail a PDF.</p>
            <p>If you are currently using a multifunction machine with a shared phone line, you’re missing an
                opportunity to operate more efficiently. There are very good reasons why cloud fax technology continues
                to be widely used. WestFax makes the process painless.</p>
