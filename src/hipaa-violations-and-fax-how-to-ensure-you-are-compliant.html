            It doesn’t need to be said, but HIPAA compliance is serious business. Entire industries have been built
            around
            making sure medical facilities, doctors offices and insurers are complying with all the privacy and data
            protection laws and guidelines. Here are some straightforward tips for keeping your faxing on the right side
            of
            the law. HIPAA Violations are no joke.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li class="text-dark">
                <strong>Don’t allow incoming faxes sit on publicly available fax machines or within visual range of
                    unallowed 3rd parties.</strong>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    If one is receiving faxed protected documents ensure that your machine is in a private non-public
                    location. When sending a protected fax, call the receiver to ensure that their fax machine is in a
                    private or protected location. If the fax machine is physically located on a desk ensure that
                    patients and clients walking by cannot see the contents of faxes being received.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li class="text-dark">
                <strong>While you’re at it, dump your manual fax machine and use a HIPAA compliant cloud fax
                    service.</strong>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    Immediately this will save you money, make it easier to manage sending and receiving faxes, and
                    offers the added security of encryption technology when sending and storing faxes. Make sure your
                    cloud fax service encrypts all your documents and is setup for HIPAA fax. WestFax offers <a

            <li class="text-dark">
                <strong>
                    Always use cover pages.
                </strong>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    HIPAA requirements dictate that one uses a cover sheet with the approved HIPAA statement when
                    transmitting PHI. Be sure to use a Confidentiality Statement on your fax cover sheets when sending
                    patient information. This is an example of a Confidentiality Statement:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote border-left border-primary">
                    <p class="ml-4 text-muted">
                        <i>The documents accompanying this facsimile transmittal are intended only for the use of the
                            individual or entity to which it is addressed. It may contain information that is
                            privileged, confidential and exempt from disclosure under law. If the reader of this message
                            is not the intended recipient, you are notified that any dissemination, distribution or

                            you are hereby notified that law strictly prohibits any disclosure, copying, distribution or

                            in error, please notify the sender immediately to arrange for return of these documents.</i>
                    </p>

                        In order to be HIPAA compliant, your fax cover sheet should also include the following items:

                    <ul class="text-muted">

                    If you don’t have an accurate audit trail of every activity that occurred with each patient
                    document, then you are susceptible to fines associated with non-compliance.

                    HIPAA is not optional and until all IT assets and architectures are re-engineered to be
                    intrinsically HIPAA compliant everyone must be vigilant and attentive to PHI handing requirements
                    and best practices.
