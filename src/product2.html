            <p class="pt-3">Once the tool is installed you just select the default printer you want to use for your inbound faxes. Then you select “Enable”. That’s it! We’ll print any fax that comes in. Want to turn it off? Just click disable and turn it back on when you want to resume printing.</p></div>

            <p class="pt-3">Gone are the days of setting up secure FTP (although we’ll still support it if you need it). Just select your primary backup location and your secondary backup location, if you need redundancy, and click enable. We’ll download every fax you have on our servers and keep it synchronized automatically.
