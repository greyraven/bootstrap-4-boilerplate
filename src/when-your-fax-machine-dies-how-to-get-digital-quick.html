            So the old fax machine bit the dust. What to do now? Do you run to the store to buy a replacement or maybe this is a great time to go digital finally.

            <p class="text-muted">First things first. We need to make sure you are still able to receive faxes.</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="text-muted">Sign up for a <a href="/pricing/">free trial for online faxing</a>. Pick any number because it won’t matter once you port your number.</li>
                <li class="text-muted">Contact your phone provider (the company you are paying for your fax land line) and have them forward your number to the new fax number.</li>
                <li class="text-muted">Fill out a <a href="/porting-form/">Port request form</a> and have your online fax provider port your old fax number to the online service.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Porting your number is pretty quick. It shouldn’t take more than a day or two. Now all of your faxing is in the cloud and you can cancel your land-line, get rid of your old fax machine (remember to dispose of it greenly) and enjoy the flexibility, security and reliability of your online fax service.
                <br><br>
                WestFax offers a <a href="/pricing/">10 day free trial</a> so give it a try. We are positive you will never go back to a fax machine again.
