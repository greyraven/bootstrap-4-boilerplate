            Just <a href="/downloads/westfax_setup_x64.zip">download the driver</a> and install it. When you are done it will prompt you to login. Just use the same credentials as your Fax To Email account And you are all set!

        <p class="lead text-muted pb-5">
            Just enter your recipient’s fax number(s) and hit send. Faxing! Done!
