         WestFax provides multiple ways of sending a fax, making the process simple and painless. Most don’t even require you to walk away from your computer. One popular method is to use the <a href="https://westfax.com/print-to-fax/">WestFax Print To Fax driver</a>. It’s a small program that installs on your computer and emulates a Windows printer. Once you have installed it, sending a fax is as easy as printing a document. <br><br>Here is how it works:

        </p>

        <p>
           <strong>Step One: Download and Install the Print To Fax Driver</strong><br>
           First, <a href="https://westfax.com/print-to-fax/">download the free Print To Fax driver from WestFax</a>. When you open the downloaded file, you’ll have two options. If you’re using a newer 64-bit version of Windows, double-click on the “x64” installer. For 32-bit versions of Windows, choose “x86” instead. (If you’re not sure which Windows version you have, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/determine-whether-your-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64-bit-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-aac162a1-0cb3-46f2-888f-2f22897396ce" target="_blank">click here</a> to learn how to get that information.)
<br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
         When the installation program starts, simply click “Next” to accept the default settings, and then click “Finish” on the last screen. The whole process takes less than a minute.<br><br>
         The first time the program runs it will open an empty window like this:
      </p>
      <img src="/img/p2f_1.png" alt="Print to Fax Screen 1" style="padding:30px;">
      <p>Click “Settings” and enter the login information that you entered when you set up your WestFax account. (To set up a 10-day free trial account and start sending faxes right away, <a href="https://signup.westfax.com/app/signup/start?code=Basic%20Plan">visit the WestFax website</a>.) Here’s a pro tip: if you check the “Remember Me” box under user settings, you won’t have to enter this information every time you restart your computer.</p>

       <p>
      <strong>
         Step Two: “Print” Your Document to Fax</strong><br>
         Next, open the document that you want to fax. Let’s say, for example, that you want to send a copy of your resume, which you created in Microsoft Word. Simply open the document and choose Word’s “Print” command (Ctrl-P will also work). When the Print menu opens up, the “WestFax Printer”, then click the “Print” button.
         

       </p>
       <img src="/img/p2f_2.png" alt="Print to Fax Screen 2" style="padding:30px;">

       <p>
         This will add your document to the list of outgoing faxes in the WestFax Printer window. (Don’t worry: it hasn’t been sent yet… that’s the next step!)  Your window should look something like this:
       </p>
       <img src="/img/p2f_3.png" alt="Print to Fax Screen 3" style="padding:30px;">

       <p><strong>Step Three: Enter Your Recipient’s Information and Send</strong><br>
         Next select the fax you want to send (so that it’s highlighted in red, like the picture above), and click on the “Start Fax” button. A new window will open up where you can enter your recipient’s fax number. Simply enter that information in the “Fax Number” field, or select the “Contact” button to choose a recipient from your list of contacts.
         </p>
         <img src="/img/p2f_4.png" alt="Print to Fax Screen 4" style="padding:30px;">
         <p>
            Click “Add” to add the fax number to the list of recipients. You can send the same fax to multiple recipients simply by adding more of them to the list. <br><br>
            By selecting the “Fax Options” tab, you can add a descriptive header to your fax, a subject line, and a reference (such as an account number, for example). If you need to specify a particular individual as the recipient, you can also enter that information here.<br><br>
            On the “Cover Page” tab, you can select a pre-defined cover page, and you can add additional notes to appear on the cover page, – for example “It was great speaking to you this afternoon. Here is a copy of my resume, as we discussed.”<br><br>
            To finish the process, simply click the “Send fax” button. You will see a message that indicates your fax has been sent successfully. You’re done!<br><br>
            Although the example we have provided is based on printing from Microsoft Word, the <a href="https://westfax.com/print-to-fax/">WestFax Print To Fax driver</a> really allows you to send a fax from virtually any application, because it emulates a Windows-compatible printer. You could use it to send a PDF, an Excel spreadsheet, or even a web page. Any document that you could print to a normal printer can also be sent using the Print to Fax driver.
