            SPF or “Sender Policy Framework” is a email server security setting that is becoming standard. It enables a domain (xyz.com) to publicly state which servers may send emails on your behalf. Basically it’s like a blue check mark on twitter but for email. It lets other Email servers know that the email you sent is really from your domain and not some forged email by some hacker overseas. A vast majority of servers are already setup for SPF and the setup is rather easy but some administrators may have missed it or haven't implemented it yet.

            <br><br>
            <h3>Why is this important and why are we enforcing it.</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            If someone were to compromise your systems and gain an understanding of your configuration they could forge emails from your domain to anyone else utilizing our Email to Fax Service. A scammer could send fake invoices to your customers, outside of Email to Fax they could send viruses and randsomware to your customers or anyone else and it would appear to come from your domain and email account. When your SPF is properly setup scammers can still try to do this but the receiving email servers would spot the fake quickly and remove it. We have recently restricted emails from senders that do not support SPF to prevent the aforementioned situation from occurring. It may be temporarily inconvenient but we put security first at WestFax and we can help you figure this out.
