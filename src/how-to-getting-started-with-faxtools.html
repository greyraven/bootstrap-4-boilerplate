         What is FaxTools?
      </h2>
      <p><strong>AutoPrint:</strong> Anytime a fax comes in to your fax line it will print the fax automatically to a
         selected printer.<br><br>
         <strong>FaxDrive:</strong> Automatically download all incoming faxes to a local or network drive. We also have
         a
         secondary backup location to ensure you have redundancy.</p>

               <p class="lead text-muted">This is the home screen. You will be prompted to login using your WestFax Fax
                  to Email credentials. If you have forgotten them click here to reset them.</p>
               <img src="/img/faxtools_2.png" alt="fax tools 2" class="img-fluid pt-4" />
               <p class="lead text-muted">After logging in you will see a popup that asks you to select the fax line you
                  want to manage. If you only have one fax line just click continue. Otherwise, if you have more than
                  one pick the line you want to start with. You can toggle fax lines anytime inside the application.</p>
                  <img src="/img/faxtools_3.png" alt="Fax Tools 3" class="img-fluid pt-4">
               <p class="lead text-muted">Now you are shown the landing page. This is where you will configure your
                  AutoPrint and FaxDrive. Let’s start first with the AutoPrint. The first thing you need to have is a
                  printer available on your computer. It can be a network printer or a local printer but you must have
                  at least one printer installed.
               </p>
               <img src="/img/faxtools_4.png" alt="Fax Tools 4" class="img-fluid pt-4">
               <p class="lead text-muted">Just select the printer you want to automatically print faxes and click the
                  Enable button. That’s it! You are done! Any fax coming in after you click enable will be printed
                  automatically. Want to check on your printer status? Just click “View Print Queue” and you can see
                  what’s in the queue. Sometimes print jobs may be stuck because of paper jam or no paper. This is where
                  you can see what’s printing.
               </p>
               <img src="/img/faxtools_5.png" alt="Fax Tools 5" class="img-fluid pt4">
               <p class="lead text-muted">Let’s setup the FaxDrive now. The first thing to select is the File Format.
                  PDF or TIFF. If you aren’t sure just choose PDF. Next, choose a primary location for the faxes to be
                  saved. Make sure you have plenty of space if you have a lot of faxes. Most faxes average 20-150kb in
                  size but it really depends on how many pages you are receiving. You can also select a secondary
                  location in case you need to have a redundant file store. This ensures your faxes are secure in case
                  your computer crashes and you need a backup location. You don’t have to set a secondary location but
                  we offer it just in case.</p>
               </p>
               <p class="lead text-muted">Once you have the location set click the Enable Toggle. The faxes will start
                  downloading in the background automatically. You can click the “View” button to see the folder and
                  watch them download.

               </p>
               <p class="lead text-muted">You can also click a checkbox that says “Delete Remote after download”. This
                  is for customers that do not want faxes to remain on the fax server for HIPAA reasons or security
                  reasons. This option will mark a fax as deleted and as soon as it downloads it will be removed.
                  <strong>Caution:</strong> If you select this option faxes will be removed from the inbox on your
                  home.westfax.com portal.

               </p>
               <p class="lead text-muted">The last option “Resync” is useful if you need to start the sync process over
                  because you changed the backup location.
               </p>
               <img src="/img/faxtools_6.png" alt="Fax Tools 6" class="img-fluid pt-4">
               <p class="lead text-muted">Let’s talk about the settings page. We offer the ability to set a lockscreen.
                  This prevents anyone from viewing your fax settings unintentionally. Just click the Gear Icon on the
                  top right. Then you can choose to enable the Lock screen by clicking “Lock App screen after” and then
                  choose how long you want to wait before the lock screen kicks in. Then set a pin code (numeric only).
                  <br><br>
                  You’ll see the lock screen after the set timeout and it will prompt you to enter your pin to unlock
                  the interface.
                  <br><br>
                  That’s it! You are setup. If you close the window it will still be in your tray. Just click it and it
                  will relaunch the control panel.
                  <br><br>
                  If that’s all you need to do you are good.</p>

               <p class="lead">Advanced users read on:</p>
               <p class="lead text-muted"> If you have multiple fax numbers you can select additional fax lines under
                  the product drop down. This will allow you to setup AutoPrint and FaxDrive for several fax lines at
                  the same time so you can manage multiple fax lines independently.
                  <br><br>
                  Just toggle the fax lines to change or verify settings.</p>

               <p class="lead">HIPAA Compliance and FaxDrive</p>
               <p class="lead text-muted">Extra care must be taken when handling PHI. <a
                     href="/most-common-hipaa-violations-and-how-to-avoid-them/">We’ve talked about Fax and HIPAA
                     compliance before</a> and it’s important that your organization takes HIPAA guidelines into
                  account. If you are printing faxes using AutoPrint that contain PHI then be sure the printer is in a
                  secure location where the public doesn’t have access. Think of your printer as a physical fax machine
                  and treat it accordingly.
                  <br><br>
                  With FaxDrive you should be sure that the fax documents are being saved in a location that is secure,
                  encrypted and not available to anyone who shouldn’t have access to PHI. Saving files to network shares
                  is fine as long as your network is secure and proper permissions are in place.</p>
