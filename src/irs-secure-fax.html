            The IRS gets flack for a lot of reasons but one <a

                article regarding the IRS use of fax</a>
            machines is misleading. Yes, everyone knows that old physical fax machines are dated and the migration of
            many legacy machines to newer Fax to Email services are commonplace but the IRS still utilizes fax
            technology because it just works and is more secure. Whereas emails can get stuck in spam filters or never
            make it there because of a mistyped email address, fax provides a confirmation and security that email
            cannot easily mimic.

            Email’s can be intercepted, injected and loaded with malware in transit whereas the technology level
            needed to intercept a fax communication and alter or change it would be tremendously difficult and thus
            is not an active target by criminals and hackers.

            Faxing and the IRS
        </strong>

            Should you be audited or the IRS requires more information from you to process your return you are far <a

            to the IRS vs emailing it or using postal mail. If you value your privacy then utilizing Fax services will
            prevent snooping by hackers of sensitive financial and legal information. Email’s, unless manually
            encrypted, can be intercepted. If someone were to try to intercept a fax transmission they would mostly see
            just static noise.

            This is why HIPAA (Medical document handling regulations) favor fax over email. Until email and online
            solutions up their game and provide better security; fax is here to stay.
