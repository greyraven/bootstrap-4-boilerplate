    </p>
    
    <p>
        Once we get your form, we’ll begin porting your number. You can still use the new number you just signed up with to test it but once the port is complete, you will get all your hard faxes in digital PDF format delivered to your inbox. No more paper jams, paper expense or missed faxes. No more busy signals.

    <p>
        Porting is not as hard are you might think. You just need to have your billing information handy and fill out a basic form. It’s easy and it will save you hundreds of dollars in telephone line costs a year.
