                    We will assume you are using a relatively modern development framework. PHP, React, .Net, etc…

                <li>
                    We recommend you use a tool like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> (Free and
                    available on all platforms) to test your API’s and generate the code or you can run in a sandbox at
                    <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/WestFax2/WestFax_API_2/2.0-oas3#/">SwaggerHub</a>.

        <div>
            <h3 class="text-dark">What is this useful for:</h3>
            <p>
                This is useful if you have multiple inbound fax lines and you need to check them for new inbound faxes.
                Just calling this one procedure will alert you to new inbound faxes and you can then go and retrieve the
                metadata about the new faxes. If nothing is new you don’t have to make a call for each productID which
                saves server time and resources.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>
                <strong>Phase 1: Let’s check our Fax number for new faxes.</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>
                In this case I have sent myself a test fax before I run this proc.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am going to fire up SwaggerHub and use the Tryout function to call the procedure and get data back.
            </p>
            <p>
                The procedure is called Fax_GetProductsWithInboundFaxes. You can see it’s spec <a
                    href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/WestFax2/WestFax_API_2/2.0-oas3#/Core/FaxGetProductsWithInboundFaxesRespEncPost">here</a>.

            <img width="600px" src="/img/new-api-call-image.png" class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-2">
        </div>

        <div>
            <ol class="text-muted">
                <li>
                    We’ll be asked to enter the Username and Password for our WestFax API Call. Notice we are not
                    specifying a prodid as this procedure works across all fax lines and will return a collection of fax
                    lines if the filter field matches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let’s talk about the filter field. If you leave it blank it will assume Unread flag. You can set it
                    to None, Recieved & Removed. None or <blank> will show you Fax numbers that have unread faxes.
                        Recieved will show you fax lines that have read faxes and removed will show you faxes that have
                        deleted faxes. These are unlikely use-cases but here nevertheless.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>So here is the call</p>
                    <img width="600px" src="/img/new-api-call-image-2.png" class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-2">
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>When I execute it I get back:</p>
                    <img width="600px" src="/img/new-api-call-image-3.png" class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-2">
                </li>

                <li>
                    You can see that it returns a ID record as well as the InboundNumber so you can now go call the
                    Fax_GetFaxDescriptions or Fax_GetInboundFaxDescriptions. Set your FaxDirection as Inbound and you
                    can now update your app with the new incoming faxes.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Success!</strong> As you can see it’s not hard at all to add Faxing to your Enterprise application.
