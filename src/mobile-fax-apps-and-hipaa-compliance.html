            Much of the information that is shared between hospitals, doctors, insurance companies, and other healthcare
            entities is sent using fax. After all, fax is highly secure, flexible, and easy to use. For organizations
            that are sending and receiving Protected Health Information (PHI) and other confidential data, however,
            special precautions need to be taken, especially with regard to the use of mobile devices.

        <p>
            When smart pagers and mobile phones first appeared on the scene in the early 2000’s, IT administrators
            struggled with a new challenge; an entire category of new devices capable of storing confidential
            information began to proliferate. Although the general problem of mobile security can be effectively
            addressed by observing some basic security practices, organizations that deal with PHI need to take extra
            care in safeguarding patient information protected by <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">HIPAA
                (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)</a>.
        </p>

                For healthcare organizations that rely on mobile devices to share information, <a
                    href="/what-is-a-hipaa-compliant-fax/">HIPAA-compliant fax</a>&nbsp;provides a secure
                and dependable starting point. Accessing faxes from a mobile device conforms to HIPAA requirements,
                provided that certain policies and procedures are followed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The overriding principles for HIPAA compliant use of mobile devices are:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Information should never be forwarded without the patient’s consent.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Data should not be accessed or stored any longer than needed.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Data should be encrypted to provide an additional layer of safeguarding against breach of
                    confidentiality.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>
                Follow general standards for mobile device security
            </h2>

            <p>
                Begin by ensuring that users are following standard security practices for mobile devices. Most of us
                are familiar with these rules; for example, that users should prevent unauthorized access to their
                devices by using a secure password. Users should also apply software updates and patches promptly; as
                soon as they become available, and avoid connecting to unsecured Wi-Fi networks, especially when viewing
                data that may be sensitive or confidential. Finally, mobile device users should be careful about
                downloading and installing software that they have not researched in advance, as many mobile apps have
                been the source of malware.
            </p>

            <p>
                While many of us know these rules well and follow them consistently, healthcare organizations should not
                assume that everyone necessarily knows about good mobile security practices. That’s why it’s important
                to regularly train users in basic security practices. This is especially true if employees are using
                their own personal device at work.
            </p>

            <h2>Have a clear set of written policies for the use of mobile devices</h2>

            <p>
                In addition to training, healthcare organizations should have clear written policies that outline
                required practices for any mobile device that will be used to access PHI. Such policies should clearly
                specify best practices for mobile device security, but should also cover additional topics, such as
                procedures to be followed in the event that a mobile device is lost or stolen. If the organization has a
                “bring your own device“ policy, then written guidelines should also address the steps that need to be
                taken when such a device is sold or otherwise disposed of.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a template policy, a good place to start is John R. Christiansen’s “<a
                    href="https://christiansenlaw.net/2012/09/hipaa-mobile-devices-policy-open-source/">HIPAA Mobile

                private patient information will remain protected.
