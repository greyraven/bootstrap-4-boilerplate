                    <span class="answer">An Application Programming Interface (<abbr class="text-primary"
                            title="Application programming interface">API</abbr>) is a set of routines, protocols, and
                        tools for building software applications an <abbr class="text-primary"
                            title="Application Programming Interfer">API</abbr> specifies how software components should
                        interact. Additionally <abbr class="text-primary" title="Applications programming intefaces">APIs</abbr> are used
                        when programming graphical user inteface (<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>)
                        components. [<a

                    <span class="answer">An API can be “Consumed” by any number of websites, tools and systems. If you
                        have an EMR or CRM you can integrate with our API to have a fax automatically send whenever you
                        add a new customer or any other functionality. Your IT staff can integrate with our API and
                        send/receive faxes from any application that supports custom integrations.</span>

                <span class="question">In what languages is your FAX API available?</span> <br>
                    <span id="answer">Our API is written in a format called “REST”. This is an industry standard
                        interface that most API’s comply with. We have samples in PHP, .NET, C#, Python and more. If you
                        use Postman you can check out our custom <a
                            href="https://apidocs.westfax.com/?version=latest">Postman integration</a> and generate code
                        in dozens of other languages. Any language that can consume an API is compatible with our
                        API.</span>

                    <span class="answer">Yes, We can integrate into any EMR. It starts with something as simple as <a
                            href="https://westfax.com/print-to-fax/">Print to Fax</a> driver and we can also perform
                        custom integration into your EMR using our HIPAA Compliant Secure Fax API. Please <a

                    <span class="answer">Not necessarily. Some CRMs and EMR have plugins that allow for simple drag and
                        drop API integrations. We can also assist with a custom integration on a case by case basis.
