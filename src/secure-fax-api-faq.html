                    <span class="answer">A: An Application Programming Interface (<abbr class="text-primary"
                            title="Application programming interface">API</abbr>) is a set of routines, protocols, and
                        tools for building software applications an <abbr class="text-primary"
                            title="Application Programming Interfer">API</abbr> specifies how software components should
                        interact. Additionally <abbr class="text-primary" title="Applications programming intefaces">APIs</abbr> are used
                        when programming graphical user inteface (<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>)
                        components. [<a

                    <span class="question">Q: What can we do with an API?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">A: An API can be “Consumed” by any number of websites, tools and systems. If you
                        have an EMR or CRM you can integrate with our API to have a fax automatically send whenever you
                        add a new customer or any other functionality. Your IT staff can integrate with our API and
                        send/receive faxes from any application that supports custom integrations.</span>

                <li>
                <span class="question">Q: In what languages is your API available?</span> <br>
                    <span id="answer">A: Our API is written in a format called “REST”. This is an industry standard
                        interface that most API’s comply with. We have samples in PHP, .NET, C#, Python and more. If you
                        use Postman you can check out our custom <a
                            href="https://apidocs.westfax.com/?version=latest">Postman integration</a> and generate code
                        in dozens of other languages. Any language that can consume an API is compatible with our
                        API.</span>

                    <span class="answer">A: Great question! We <a

                    <span class="question">Q: We use an EMR. Can you integrate fax into our workflow?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">A: Yes, We can integrate into any EMR. It starts with something as simple as <a
                            href="https://westfax.com/print-to-fax/">Print to Fax</a> driver and we can also perform
                        custom integration into your EMR using our HIPAA Compliant Secure Fax API. Please <a

                    <span class="question">Q: Do I need to be a developer to use your API?</span> <br>
                    <span class="answer">A: Not necessarily. Some CRMs and EMR have plugins that allow for simple drag and
                        drop API integrations. We can also assist with a custom integration on a case by case basis.
                        Please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> and let us know what you need and we’ll get

                    <span class="answer">A: We utilize the highest level of TLS encryption available for data in transit
                        either through our secure website or secure API interfaces. We also use AES 256 bit encryption
                        of ePHI data to guarantee privacy and prevent disclosure from intrusion. We support TLS
                        protected SMTP email with optional REQUIRE TLS extension in accordance with the IETF RFC 3207.
                        FTPS and SFTP with TLS for safe and secure transport of documents to and from your existing
                        servers. Comprehensive HTTPS API allows for easy and flexible integration of systems.</span>
