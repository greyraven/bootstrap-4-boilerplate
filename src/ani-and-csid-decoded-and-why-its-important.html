            ANI AND CSID DECODED AND WHY IT’S IMPORTANT.
        </h1>

    </div>

    <div class="text-muted">
        <p>
            The ANI is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_number_identification">Automatic Number
                Identification</a>. It is used by the phone carriers to determine the originating fax or telephone
            number for any call. ANI is different, conceptually and technically, from <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caller_ID">caller ID</a> service. A caller’s telephone number and
            line type are captured by ANI service even if <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caller_ID#Blocking">caller ID blocking</a> is activated.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you set your ANI in an API call please set the number to your fax number with no spaces or punctuation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Example: 3335551212
        </p>

        <p>
            If you set it to an invalid number, the receiver may block it as invalid or spam. If you are testing your
            API, and you can’t get the receiving fax line to accept the call, it could be because their carrier is
            blocking invalid ANI.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>CSID</strong> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Called_subscriber_identification">Called
                Subscriber Identification</a> (abbreviated CSID), and is a fax number that identifies the specific fax
            machine sending the fax. A CSID is not required in all cases, but it is a good practice to set so that your
            fax machine will not get blocked for being spam or unknown.
        </p>

        <p>
            In some cases, one would want to set the CSID to another number if you want to have the receiver send
            responses to another number. Think of it as a REPLY TO field on email. If one has many outbound fax lines,
            but one wants people to fax back to a specific return fax number, one could set the CSID to the primary
            inbound line so it appears the fax came from that number.
        </p>

        <p>
            CSID is a string that identifies a sending fax machine. This data is transmitted as part of the fax protocol
            when the fax transmission is negotiated. This identifier can contain numbers, letters and punctuation. Often
            it will contain the sending fax number along with a company name. “Acme Inc. (303) 555-1212” for instance.
            Again this is part of the fax protocol and is completely separate from ANI.
        </p>

        <p>
            In summary, when sending faxes with the API it is important to set these values correctly and not just mash
            numbers in or use placeholders. Many failed test faxes fail because of invalid ANIs.
