            A coversheet on a fax is critical for privacy and security of ePHI: Electronic Personal Health Information as well as to make sure the end reciever knows what they are seeing. We have included two examples here. A HIPAA version which contains a generic HIPAA disclaimer and a "Business-class" coverpage that has a standard disclaimer.

                There is no official HIPAA cover sheet but the cover sheet should contain the following information to be considered HIPAA compliant:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li class="m-2">
                    Date and Time Fax sent
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    Receiver name and fax #
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    Sender name, organization and phone #
