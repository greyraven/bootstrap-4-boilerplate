            Hey WestFax users!
            Great news! Last month, as you may or may not know we rolled out built in coverpages into the Print Driver and the Fax Console.  Now we have integrated coverpages into Email to Fax. Now, adding a coverpage is as simple as adding a little piece of text into your email subject.        </p>

        <p>
        You probably already know how to send a fax via Email to Fax. It's essentially just sending an email with the destination address formatted as a faxnumber@westfax.com (i.e. 5551112222@westfax.com). You can learn more about that here. <br><br>

        Adding a coverpage used to require manually attaching a word or pdf document to your email as an attachment. Well, that was the old way. The new way is much easier.

        <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First you need to create your coverpage. To do this you need to login into the Fax Console site. It is located <a href="https://home.westfax.com" target="_blank">here at https://home.westfax.com</a><br><br></li>
            <li>Now, you want to click on the <strong>Settings</strong>-><strong>Cover Page Designer</strong><br><br></li>
            <li>You will see a simple blank coverpage come up. See this below:<br><br><img src="/img/coverpage_1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" class="p-4 img-fluid" alt="blank coverpage"/><br><br> </li>
            <li>Click the <code>+ Add New</code> button<br><br></li>
            <li>Now you will want to name the Coverpage <code>default</code>. This will be the default coverpage used for your account. Note: You can have more than one coverpage. Just ensure you have one called <code>default</code>.<br><br></li>
            <li>Ok, so you can then update the <code>Company Name, Address Block, Logo image and Footer Text</code><br><br></li>
            <li><br>When you are done click <code>Save</code>. Thats It! Now you have a default cover page.<br><br></li>
            <li>You can also watch our <a href="https://youtu.be/d903hJRiqMM" target="_blank">fax console video here to learn how to make a coverpage.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <br><br>
        Ok, now you want to confirm that you are an <code>Allowed Sender</code>. You can do this by going to <strong>Settings</strong>-><strong>Account Settings.</strong> Just be sure that your email address in the list of <code>Allowed Senders</code>. Ok, moving forward...
        <br/><br/>

        So open any email program you use and create a new email. The to Address should be a fax number @westfax.com. So if you wanted to send a fax to 555-111-2222 you would send the email to 5551112222@westfax.com. 
        <br><br>
        Now add any file attachments. This will be the documents that are converted to a fax and transmitted.
        <br><br>
        Ok, so you have your attachment, your email (fax address) and all you need to do is type in the Subject. The subject should contain a small simple word or two that will show up on the header of the fax document. In our example below we are usng <code>Claim #298493</code>. The only thing you need to do is include a <strong><code>/cp</code></strong> at the end of the subject<br><small>(Advanced: You can use /cp <code>coverpagename</code> to specify a different coverpage instead of default)<br><br>
            <img src="/img/emailCover_1.png" style="max-width: 600px;" class="p-4 img-fluid" alt="Email Coverpage"><br><br>

            <strong>Hit Send! That's it!</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> You can send a fax to yourself. Just use your fax number for the to address. This way you can test it out.<br><br>
