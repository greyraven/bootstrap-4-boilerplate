            <h2>Here are 3 reasons it makes sense to make the switch:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li class="text-muted"> <strong class="text-dark">Money.</strong> plain and simple. Fax machines need toner, paper, occasional replacement and a dedicated phone line. This adds up depending on your usage. $100â€™s a month just to keep that machine working.</li>
                <li class="text-muted"><strong class="text-dark">Security.</strong> A physical fax machine can be a security risk as anyone with access to it can see incoming and outgoing faxes. Online faxing is much more secure and faxes can be specifically routed to any individual or group that needs it.</li>
                <li class="text-muted"><strong class="text-dark">Convenience and availability.</strong> Being able to send / receive and manage faxes using any computer or mobile device makes managing your faxing much easier. No longer are you bound to the office. One can receive and send a fax from any device.</li>
                <li class="text-muted"><strong class="text-dark">Enhanced workflow.</strong> With online faxing such as WestFax you can route incoming faxes to certain individuals or group email boxes. With the FaxForward functionality you can allow anyone in your organization to send a fax as easily as sending and email. No more having to fill out cover letters and printing off documents. Just attach the document in the email and send it. Easy and no need to deal with busy signals or hardware issues.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Regardless of the reason your fax machine will eventually break and the time and money spent on paper, ink and the landline cost
