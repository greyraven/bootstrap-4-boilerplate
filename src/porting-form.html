            Typically, toll-free number ports take 2-5 days to complete and local number ports may take up to 2-6 weeks. During the porting process, do not disconnect the number you want ported from your current carrier. You may also email a copy of your most current bill to porting@westfax.com or fax to (888) 331-2084. We only need the cover page that shows the name on the account, address, and the phone number(s) listed above.
