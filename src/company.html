            </h1>
            <p>
                The WestFax story began in 1998 when founder Barry Clark was transitioning out of the wholesale travel
                business. Now 20 years later WestFax has become a global leader in Broadcast fax, fax to e-mail and
                enhanced API fax connectivity for companies worldwide. Our legacy TDM network is what sets us apart from
                our competitors. Our customers find a much higher completion percentage using our platform because we
                know how best to connect to fax recipients based on the telecom carrier the receiving fax device is
                connected to. We use a matrix of carriers to determine the best carrier route for your fax. Our
                innovative fax to e-mail product allows Android and iOS users to send and receive faxes from anywhere
                using their mobile device.
                <br />
                <br />
                After a few years in Downtown Denver, the Denver Tech Center is now our home. We also have offices in
                Southern California and South Florida.
