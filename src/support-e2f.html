               <span class="question">Can I send a fax from my Gmail?</span> <br>
               <span class="answer">It’s easy to send a fax using Gmail. Click on the “compose” button to start a new e-mail. In the “To” address field, enter the fax number, followed by “@westfax.com”.  Simply attach a document or image file to the e-mail, and send it.  WestFax will identify it as a fax from your account (based on the Gmail address that you are using to send it), and it will be sent as an outbound fax from your account.</span>

               <span class="question">Can I send a fax from Word?</span> <br>
               <span class="answer">There are several different ways to send a fax from Microsoft Word. The simplest method is to use the WestFax print driver, which emulates a printer on your computer.  By printing the Word file to the WestFax driver and adding your recipient’s fax number, WestFax will automatically route the printing of the Word document to your recipient’s fax machine. WestFax also makes it easy to send word documents as faxes, simply by attaching them to an e-mail or uploading them to the WestFax portal.

               <span class="question">Is it safe to fax documents?</span> <br>
               <span class="answer">Fax is safer than many other methods of transmitting information.  It offers a high level of security and safety, especially when it is offered through a vendor who works with healthcare organizations that must adhere to HIPAA regulations. Banks, healthcare providers needing HIPAA compliance, and government offices continue to use fax routinely.

               <span class="question">Can I send a fax from my Outlook email?</span> <br>
               <span class="answer">To send a fax from your Outlook e-mail, simply attach a Word document, PDF, or image file to an e-mail, and address it to the destination phone number, adding “@westfax.com” to the end.  WestFax will automatically associate the fax with your account, based on the e-mail address from which it is being sent.

            <span class="question">What is always required when you are sending a fax?</span> <br>
            <span class="answer">We recommend always including a cover page with your fax. In the case of HIPAA covered organizations, we strongly recommend using a <a href="https://westfax.com/fax-confidentiality-statements/" target="_blank">HIPAA-specific cover page with a confidentiality statement</a>.  WestFax makes it easy to send a fax through our secure online portal, by sending the fax as an e-mail attachment (as a PDF, Word file, or image), or using the WestFax Print to Fax driver. Fax transmission capabilities can also be built into software using the WestFax API. Users can also send and receive faxes via our service using traditional fax machine..</span>

            <span class="question">What must you include as part of all faxes that contain protected health information?</span> <br>
            <span class="answer">HIPAA compliant faxes containing protected health information should always include a <a href="https://westfax.com/fax-confidentiality-statements/" target="_blank">cover sheet that includes a confidentiality statement</a>, as well as the name of the recipient, their fax number, and the name, organization, and contact information of the sender.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="question">Do I need to buy any software or hardware?</span> <br>
