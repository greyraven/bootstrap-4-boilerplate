            You have your enterprise application coded but you need to be able to send faxes occasionally. Sure, you
            could just generate a PDF, Print it off and then fax it. But with just a few lines of code you can integrate
            faxing into your application. Here are some simple instructions to get your application fax enabled. In this
            article we will show you how to send a fax.
        </p>

        <div>
            <p>
                Here is what you need:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class="m-2">
                    We will assume you are using a relatively modern development framework. PHP, React, .Net, etc…
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    We recommend you use a tool like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> (Free and
                    available on all platforms) to test your API’s and generate the code.
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    <a href="/developer-registration/">Developer API account</a>. Easy to sign up and get started
                    immediately.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
            The WestFax API is comprised of a large set of methods that are exposed using a RESTful interface. Data can
            be interchanged in a number of formats including JSON and XML. Additionally, WestFax offers SOAP and RPC
            bindings that are described elsewhere. For the purposes of this demo the REST interface with JSON encoding
            is used.
        </p>

        <div>
            <ol>
                <li class="m-2">
                    Get the sample code for Postman. <a href="https://github.com/westfax/API-Postman">Link here</a>.
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>Click Download or Fork it to your local repo.</p>
                    <div>
                        <img width="300px" class="img-fluid" src="/img/how_1.png"
                            alt="GitHub Clone Dropdown image">

                    <p>
                        Once you have the local files you should see two Json Files: WestFaxApi_Postman_collection.json
                        and WestFaxApiEnvironment.postman_environment.json
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>Open Postman and create a new Request. You can call it whatever you want to call it but we will
                        use WestFax.</p>

                    <p>
                        Now go click the File -> Import command.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img class="img-fluid" width="360px" src="/img/how_3.png"

                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>
                        Drag or select the two Json Files from the code you downloaded earlier and click import.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>
                        You will see it quickly import and you will have 23 requests in your new WestFax Collection.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img class="img-fluid" width="380px" src="/img/how_4.png" alt="Postman Folder">

                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>
                        Now look at the top right corner of postman. You should see a drop down and an “eye” icon and a
                        gear icon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Select the Dropdown to select “WestFaxApiEnvironment” and then click the Eye icon.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img width="380px" class="img-fluid" src="/img/how_5.png"

                    <p>
                        You will now see a bunch of pre-defined variables. You will want to change these by clicking
                        Edit.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img width="450px" class="img-fluid" src="/img/how_7.jpg"

                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>
                        Change the default values to the ones you received when you signed up for API access.
                    </p>

                <li class="-m-2">
                    <p>
                        Now let’s go test to make sure we are connecting ok and getting a response from the server. On
                        the left menu under “23 requests” select the “Security_Ping”. Go ahead and click the blue “SEND”
                        button.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img width="360px" class="img-fluid" src="/img/how_8.png"

                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>
                        You should see something like this come back from the API. If not please feel free to <a
                            href="/contact/">contact us</a> for support.
                    </p>
                    <div><img width="360px" class="img-fluid" src="/img/how_9.png"
                            alt="Postman Request Example"></div>

                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>
                        Now let’s try to send a fax. If you have an incoming number attached to your account you can use
                        that or any other fax number. You can also use the well known HP Faxback test number at
                        1-888-473-2963. They will fax you back that they received your fax usually within 5 minutes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>So click the Fax_SendFax method on the left and you will see this for your Body setup.</p>
                    <div>
                        <img width="360px" class="img-fluid" src="/img/how_10.png" alt="Fax_SendFax Method">
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>
                        The <span style="color: orange;">{{ Orange }}</span> values are filled in from the config you
                        already set so you can ignore those. The values you need to set are the
                        <strong>Numbers1</strong>, <strong>Files0</strong> fields. The rest are optional and you can
                        unclick them if you want. Although adding a <strong>FeedbackEmail</strong> value is useful to
                        get confirmation of the fax sending. Once you set all these variables go ahead and click send.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>
                        You should see a result code of True and a hash string with the confirmation code.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img width="360px" class="img-fluid" src="/img/how_11.png" alt="Response example 2">
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>
                        Ok, so here is a neat trick that Postman give us. You can get all your code done for you. Just
                        click the button “Code”. It’s kind of buried near the Send button next to cookies.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img src="/img/how_12.png" alt="image" width="360px" class="img-fluid">
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class="m-2">
                    <p>
                        Now when you click code you will get formatted code for almost any programming language you may
                        need:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img src="/img/how_13.png" alt="img" width="460px" class="img-fluid">
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ol>

        </div>
