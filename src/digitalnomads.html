        <p>Traveling the world and working remotely is a new hot trend. Whether your destination is stateside or at an exotic location you will find that living remotely can pose an interesting set of challenges. There are plenty of websites dedicated to digital nomadism but here are 5 easy ways to keep things running smoothly.</p>

        <h2>
            <a class="text-dark" href="https://gsuite.google.com/"><strong>Google Drive / Google Apps</strong></a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Odd’s are you already have this but are you fully utilizing it? There are tools such as Sheets (Excel replacement), Docs (Word Replacement) and Slides (Powerpoint) that can open, save and edit any of the aforementioned formats. But you have MS office already. Why change things? Well, that’s fine for most people but imagine if you lose your laptop or the hard drive crashes when you are in a distant land or if your luggage is stolen. If your files are on the cloud you can just use your phone or buy a cheap replacement computer and get all your data back immediately.
        </p>

        <h2><a class="text-dark" href="https://www.amazon.com/Vonage-Digital-Service-Adapter-VDV23-VD/dp/B00C3OH770/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1524869654&sr=8-2&keywords=Vonage+adapter"><strong>Vonage Phone Adapter</strong></a></h2>
        <p>
            If you maintain a business presence in the US or need to be on the phone then you already know that cell phones are not going to be optimal for this due to expensive roaming and long distance fees and spotty connection. Having a VOIP phone adapter (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vonage-Digital-Service-Adapter-VDV23-VD/dp/B00C3OH770/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1524869654&sr=8-2&keywords=Vonage+adapter">Check this out</a>) can be plugged into a network and forward your local US number to your local device. One digital nomad we know maintained his DC based business for 6 weeks in Argentina and no one knew he was there.

        <h2><a href="https://home.westfax.com/" class="text-dark"><strong>WestFax Fax to Email</strong></a></h2>
        <p>
            Similar to the phone adapter above if your business needs access to fax or document management services that use fax then having a fax to email service is critical. Using WestFax’s Fax to Email service you can have a toll free or local number and sending a fax is as simple as sending an email.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need to send documents securely or you’re in any healthcare related field, access to fax is likely essential. Sending a fax using a service ensures your important documents are secure and won’t fall into international hackers hands. Using public fax machines overseas can be monitored as well.

        <h2><a href="https://skype.com/" class="text-dark"><strong>Skype</strong></a></h2>
        <p>
            This one is pretty obvious. Get your Skype account setup and activated, test your hardware and microphone so you know it works well. Having a spotty or poorly configured Skype setup can make working remotely painful. Having a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Over-The-Head-Wireless-Headset-H600/dp/B005GTO07O/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1524869934&sr=8-6&keywords=skype+headset">solid headset</a> can make the difference. Check out these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Widescreen-Calling-Recording-Desktop/dp/B006JH8T3S/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1524869978&sr=1-4&keywords=webcam">webcams</a> too.
