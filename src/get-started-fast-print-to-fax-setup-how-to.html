                Now, enter your login and password for your Fax To Email account. <a href="https://home.westfax.com/">Can’t remember it? Click here</a>.
            </li>

            <li class="m-4">
                Now, Let’s make sure everything is set. You should see your Fax number in the “Currently Selected Product (Fax number)” box. If you have more than one number choose the one you want to fax from.
            </li>

            <li class="m-4">
                Now that you have your account authenticated you are all set!
            </li>

            <li class="m-4">
                Now, let’s open any document to print. Got one loaded? Ok… Let’s print:
            </li>

            <li class="m-4">
                <p>
                    Go to File->Print. Now in the printer selection choose “WestFax Printer”. Then hit Print.
                </p>
                <img  src="/img/Westfax_print_setup_wizard-4.png" alt="setup wizard fourth image" class="img-fluid">
            </li>

            <li class="m-4">
                Now, You will see a “Processing” Bar on the bottom right as we queue up the document. Then you will see the WestFax Printer dialog come up.
            </li>

            <li class="m-4">
                <p>
                    Now you go to the WestFax Printer tool and you will see your document name, # of pages and the status. If the document is a few pages it will take a few seconds to change the status to ready. If it is a larger document with images or a large number of pages it will take a little longer. Once it says Ready we want to click “Start Fax”. Note: You can add additional documents on this screen here if you want. Just click “Add Doc” and select any document you want to include.
                </p>

            <li class="m-4">
                <p>
                    <strong>Fax Options Tab</strong><br/>Here is where you can set the HEADER (Prints on the top middle of the outbound fax), SUBJECT (Shows up in reports and confirmation reciepts) and REFERENCE (Shows up on the subject line of the Confirmation Reciept. None of these fields are required but very useful for tracking down faxes later.
                </p>
                <img  src="/img/printer_06b.png" alt="setup wizard sixth image" class="img-fluid">
            </li>
            <li class="m-4">
                <p>
                    <strong>Cover Page Tab</strong><br/>If you have a cover page designed you can choose that here. (To create a coverpage see our <a href="https://youtu.be/d903hJRiqMM?t=188" target="_blank">video on the new Fax Console</a>). Once you select a coverpage it will be inserted into your document list and you can add a personal message and change the "From" name as well. 
                </p>
                <img  src="/img/printer_06c.png" alt="setup wizard sixth image" class="img-fluid">
            </li>
            <li class="m-4"><br><br>
                Ok, Now you are ready to send. As long as you have at least one fax recipient you can click Send Fax. You’ll see a dialog popup that says “Fax Sent”
                

            </li>

            <li>
                Done! Ok, so if you followed along your fax is on the way. You can fax yourself if you want to test it. Also, if you want to see the fax status you can log into your <a href="https://home.westfax.com/">Fax to Email</a> account and see the new outgoing fax there.
            </li>
