            Traditional paper faxing consumes over <a href="https://bebusinessed.com/online-fax/impressive-stats-of-online-fax/">200 billion pages per year</a> alone and that’s just the United States. That’s a lot of paper, and a lot of water, electricity and logging to create that paper. Switching to electronic faxing reduces or cuts out all those costs.

            Fax to Email also allows for more capable workflows and processes. A service can send faxes to multiple people via email instead of having to re-fax documents back and forth. With more and more offices have reliable scanning in their printers it is easier than even to digitize your faxing while maintaining the secure encryption and benefits of a fax service.
