  <h1>LEARN ABOUT WESTFAX</h1>
  <p class="text-muted">
    The WestFax story began in 1998 when founder Barry Clark was transitioning out of the wholesale travel business. Now 20 years later WestFax has become a global leader in Broadcast fax, fax to e-mail and enhanced API fax connectivity for companies worldwide. Our legacy TDM network is what sets us apart from our competitors. Our customers find a much higher completion percentage using our platform because we know how best to connect to fax recipients based on the telecom carrier the receiving fax device is connected to. We use a matrix of carriers to determine the best carrier route for your fax. Our innovative fax to e-mail product allows Android and iOS users to send and receive faxes from anywhere using their mobile device.

    After a few years in Downtown Denver, the Denver Tech Center is now our home. We also have offices in Southern California and South Florida.
