            <p class="text-muted">Switching is easy but there are some things you should do ahead of time to ensure a smooth transition.
            <ol>
                <li class="text-muted"><a href="/pricing/">Sign up for an Online Fax Account.</a>WestFax offers a 10 day trial so there is no risk or obligation. Pick any fax number in your area code or choose a toll free number.</li>
                <li class="text-muted">Create a list of all the email addresses you want your faxes to be distributed to. If you have a team of people who handle faxes you can have all of them receive the faxes when they come in or choose just those who need to get it. Tip: You can also add a printer’s email address (if your copier supports it) so that all faxes will be printed or stored on a printer.</li>
                <li class="text-muted">Once you get the hang of your online faxing you should <a href="/porting-form/">port your old fax number</a> o the online fax number. WestFax will walk you through porting your number so there is no interruption in your phone service.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="text-muted">
                That’s it. Once your fax number is ported you will receive faxes online and you will get an email when you receive a fax.
                <br><br>
                <i>Tip: WestFax has a feature called <a href="/how-to-send-a-fax-using-gmail/">Fax to Email</a> where anyone on your team can send faxes via email. Just include attachments and they will be converted into a fax format and sent. <a href="/how-to-send-a-fax-using-gmail/">Learn More</a></i>
