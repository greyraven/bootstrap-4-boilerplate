            More and more businesses are going green. In the early days of the eco-friendly movement businesses would
            spend more money to buy recycled paper and materials with the expectations that consumers would utilize
            their services or products over non-green competitors.

        <p>
            Nowadays going green hits the bottom lines of these businesses. In the era of increased competition and
            eco-policies, companies are <a

                longer printing their materials</a> on “100% recycled landfill recovered paper”. They aren’t printing
            anything at all!
        </p>

        <p>
            The internet is one reason: Almost any flyer or product document can be served up digitally and even product
            manuals for luxury items are download only.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another reason is to cut costs. Companies are doing away with all sorts of waste. Traditional faxes being a
            victim of this movement toward paperless workplaces.

                Hardware Faxes vs Digital Fax solutions
            </strong>

            <p>
                Fax machines <a href="/will-fax-ever-die/">will always be around</a>; however, Fax to
                Email solutions are now the go-to when it comes to fax workflows and management of fax documents.
                Utilization of scanner / copiers allows for people to print off a signature page, sign it, scan it, and
                then use a fax to email solution like WestFax to fax documents. Paper is eliminated completely when
                utilizing digital signatures from popular tools such as Adobe Acrobat.
            </p>
            <p>
                This new Fax to Email movement is saving millions of trees and millions of dollars in wasted paper
                supplies.

                Environmental impact
            </strong>
            <p>
                Using Fax to Email solutions also has the intended effect of preventing CO2 emissions and erosion in the
                environment. In the past an average person handles 10,000 pages of paper a year which is <a
                    href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-trees-are-cut-down-for-a-single-sheet-of-paper">about 1 tree’s
                    worth of paper</a>. With less paper in hand we see less demand for paper and paper production which
                is a <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1701/paper-industry/">massive industry</a>.
