            <h2> The world-class WestFax telephony platform is built with security and speed in mind.</h2>
            <p class="lead2">
                If you’ve ever been on a mobile phone call and experienced packet loss during the call you know how
                detrimental this can be to achieving efficient communication. This inconvenience during a call is
                catastrophic for fax. ANY packet loss will result in a failed fax.
                <br><br>
                The WestFax network is built on a combination of decades old legacy traditional dial mode technology and
                SIP where can’t achieve the high baud rates TDM fax allows. Our built-in AI uses historical calling data
                to determine the best carrier route, the highest possible baud rate and the best retry algorithm to make
                sure your fax has the highest chance of delivery.

                <br><br>
                <strong>This proprietary technology enables us to achieve a high percentage of 33.6 baud rate calls.</strong>
                <br><br>
                Faster baud rates are particularly important when transmitting high page count medical records.
                <br><br>
                The faster your fax is transmitted the lower the chance of failure.
                <br><br>
                <u>Many of our competitors</u> use lower cost SIP protocol to transmit fax.
                <br><br>
                Most SIP transmissions max out at a 14.4 baud rate and some competitors limit the baud rate to 9600.
                <br><br>
                This can create a situation where a 100 page medical record can take hours to transmit.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Ask your provider what the max baud for your fax transmissions are. If it’s anything lower than 33.6 you could be experiencing a much higher completion rate on the WestFax TDM fax platform.
