                For those people that pick up their phone every-time it bings, bleeps or squawks comes a tool that
                rewards you if you stay off it. You set a timer (usually 25 minutes aka <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro technique</a>) and if you
                leave it alone your virtual tree grows. After a week you can see your “Forest” of trees and see your
                Forest of productivity visualized by all the trees. This writer personally enjoyed this app and found it
                a little addicting to leave the phone alone.

                Sometimes you just need to receive a fax. Faxing is still alive and well, particularly in the world of
                medicine. HIPAA laws require your doctor to use a secure document transport method to send your medical
                records. Fax is the answer. But not the old thermal paper type of fax. WestFax provides a mobile app
                that allows you to send, receive and store your medical records securely from your smartphone. Just
                download the app in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.business.tech.westfax">Google Play</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id1354591610?mt=8">App store</a>.

                This tool can be used with the WestFax Mobile app to capture documents, clean them up, crop them and
                make them into documents that can be faxed. Just point and click and the app will import the document
                and give you something you send via email or fax.

                This little app just sneaks it’s way onto your phone the last few years. It’s surprising minimalist for
                a Google app and it looks like something they just bought, branded and released to the world. If you
                need to take a quick note, make a list or jot down an idea this app is perfect. You just open it and
                start typing. It organizes it like post it notes all laid out and easy to access. It’s simplicity is
                it’s best feature.

                Social media used to be a small passive activity usually performed by the intern or whoever had time. In
                recent years Social media can and will make or break a company. Organizations now hire an Social media
                staff to handle these functions but not all businesses can afford a full time social media manager.
                Buffer is a tool that enables a small business to create a large number of social media posts and
                schedule them over the week on a schedule. This allows a small business to spend an hour or two and get
                all the social media done and forget about it until next week.
