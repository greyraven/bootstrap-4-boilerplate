        Much of the information that is shared between hospitals, doctors, insurance companies, and other healthcare entities is sent using fax. After all, fax is highly secure, flexible, and easy to use. For organizations that are sending and receiving Protected Health Information (PHI) and other confidential data, however, special precautions need to be taken, especially with regard to the use of mobile devices.

        These claims can only be submitted using traditional paper-based forms; there is no electronic filing option available. To speed up your refund, the IRS is highly recommending that claim forms be sent via fax. If you want a clear paper trail to provide backup showing exactly what you sent and when you sent it, then electronic fax is by far the best option.

        I recently had a routine medical checkup and as I was signing in I always look over to see if they have an old fax machine sitting somewhere. At some point a medical assistant asked one of the ladies at the desk if the fax needed a cover sheet. The woman at the desk quickly assured her that all faxes get coversheets no matter what. “All Faxes get cover sheets! No exceptions…ever!”. It's good to see my Doctors office take HIPAA so seriously.

When handling sensitive medical information there is no wiggle room with regards to HIPAA safeguards. There are no guidelines on what a cover sheet should contain if transmitting HIPAA protected information however most agree that the following safeguards should be employed.

In 1964 at the height of the British pop invasion while America was still reeling from the Kennedy assassination, Xerox invented the modern office fax machine. While this office equipment staple has lost much respect over the past several years, it still remains essential to most businesses. Particularly businesses that require secure document transport to maintain HIPAA compliance. Marketing departments in every industry are also rediscovering the power of fax advertising to avoid spam filters and present a unified communication approach to reinforce their digital marketing efforts.

        The origin of the “Fax” machine has it’s roots much earlier than the more widely accepted invention of the fax by Xerox corporation in 1964. If you want to look back into history over the mechanism for reproduction of a printed object over long distance you have to look back to Scottish inventor Alexander Bain, who worked on chemical mechanical fax type devices and in 1846 was able to reproduce graphic signs. For his efforts he received a British patent for his “Electric Printing Telegraph” in 1843. Inventor Frederick Bakewell made improvements on Bain’s design and demonstrated a telefax machine. The Pantelegraph, an early form of facsimile machine transmitting over normal telegraph lines, was invented by the Italian physicist Giovanni Caselli. Thus the first commercial telefax service between Paris and Lyon in 1865, some 11 years before the invention of the telephone.
