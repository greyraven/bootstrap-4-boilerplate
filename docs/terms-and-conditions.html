                <br>
                <br>When you sign up for the FaxForward Service you are entitled to try the
                FaxForward Service on a free, 30 day, trial basis. During the free 30 day
                trial period, you are entitled to receive and send a total of 500 pages
                of faxes. If you exceed this total during the trial period you will be
                charged $0.05 for every page over 500.
                <br>
                <br> <span class="product-text">FaxForward Monthly Plan</span>

                <br>
                <br>The cost of the FaxForward Service (inbound and outbound) is $8.99 per
                month. You will be charged for the FaxForward Service on the 1st day of
                the month for the FaxForward Service for that month. Your first monthly
                charge will reflect the portion of the month remaining after your 30 day
                free trial period expires, the first full month of the FaxForward Service
                and any charges you incurred from the use of the FaxForward Service during
                the trial period (e.g. over 500 pages). Thereafter, you will be charged
                $8.99 per month plus any other charges you incur during the month.
                <br>
                <br>During each month you are entitled to receive and send a total of 500
                pages of faxes. Your account is administered by giving you a 500 page credit
                at the beginning of each month (and a proportionate amount of pages for
                the portion of the month remaining after the free 30 day trial period expires)
                and deducting from such credit all pages received and sent by you during
                the month. If you exceed this total during any month, you will be charged
                an additional $0.05 for every page over 500. If you do not use all 500
                pages, any remaining or unused pages expire at the end of each month. The
                FaxForward pages have no monetary value and do not roll over to the next
                month. There is no refund for any unused portion of the FaxForward Service.

                <br> <span class="product-text">FaxForward Storage and Search</span>

                <br>
                <br>Fax messages received and sent by you will be stored and displayed on
                the Site for 60 days after the fax is received or sent or until your account
                is terminated, whichever occurs first. These faxes are searchable by the
                dates sent and received.

                <br>You understand and agree that you are not the owner of any WestFax Services
                including any fax or voice number (“WestFax Number”) assigned to you by
                WestFax. Ownership of any such WestFax Number is vested solely in WestFax.
                WestFax is the customer of record for all WestFax Numbers. WestFax may
                assign such number to you for your use during the time of this Agreement.
                You understand and agree that following the termination of your WestFax

                <br>
                <br>You further understand and agree that WestFax may from time to time need

                <br>
                <br>WestFax’s rights to the WestFax Numbers include the right to “port” the

                legal obligation to permit you to port any WestFax Numbers. You agree not
                to transfer or attempt to transfer any WestFax Number assigned to you to
                any other telephone carrier or other person. If you violate this provision,
                you agree to immediately transfer back the WestFax Number to WestFax, pay
                WestFax for any costs and damages caused by such transfer and take any
                and all other actions as may be requested by Westfax.
                <br>
                <br>Notwithstanding the above, if you ported in any telephone number in connection
                with your use of the FaxForward Service, you may port out the telephone
                number when you terminate your account: (1) by giving WestFax written notice
                within 30 days after your account is terminated that you intend to port
                out your telephone number; (2) your telephone carrier provides WestFax’s
                telephone carrier with a signed porting request; (3) you have paid for
                all of your charges for the Services; and (4) you pay WestFax its administrative
                fee of $20.00 to cover its costs of processing the transfer. You understand
                and agree that delays, technical problems and processing issues may occur
                during the porting out period and this may prevent your new carrier from
                porting your number to it. Westfax is not responsible or liable for any
                part of the process where your telephone number is ported.
                <br>
                <br>You agree that you are not authorized to charge any Services provided
                to you or at your request to the WestFax Number assigned to you by WestFax
                and that you will not request or otherwise cause any third-party service
                provider to charge any of its services to such number. You are responsible
                for any such charges, and any such charges will give WestFax the right
                to immediately terminate your WestFax account without notice.</p>

                that you possess the legal right and ability to enter into this Agreement.
                If you are representing a corporation you warrant that you have the authority
                to bind the corporation. You agree to be financially responsible for your
                use of WestFax Services (as well as for use of your account by others,
                including minors) and to comply with your responsibilities and obligations
                as stated in these Terms.
                <br>
                <br>You must acquire and pay for all equipment and third-party services (such
                as but not limited to telephone and computer equipment) required for you
                to access and use the Services; maintain the security of your password
                and other confidential information relating to your account; and be responsible
                for all charges resulting from use of your account, including unauthorized
                use prior to your notifying WestFax of such use and taking steps to prevent
                its further occurrence. You may not sell, resell, rent or lease the use
                of the Services.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Charges
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="text-muted">You agree to pay all charges for your use of WestFax Services according
                to the payment plan applicable to your Service. WestFax reserves the right
                to prospectively change prices or institute new charges for access to or
                use of WestFax Services.
                <br>
                <br>Charges for Services may include activation, recurring subscription and
                usage fees. Your activation and recurring monthly subscription fees are
                payable in advance and are COMPLETELY NON-REFUNDABLE. For Broadcast Fax
                Service, usage charges are charged as and when such charges are incurred
                or by accumulating such charges (at the sole discretion of WestFax) in
                accordance with the usage rates that apply to the Broadcast Fax Service
                you use. For FaxForward Service, usage charges are charged on the 1st day
                of each month in accordance with the monthly rate that applies to the FaxForward
                Service you use. Overage and other charges may be applicable as well.
                <br>
                <br>Your plan may include a monthly allowance of free or set amount of faxes,
                phone calls, emails, or contacts. In the event that you have exceeded your
                plan’s limit you will be automatically charged usage fees for each fax,
                call, email or contact in excess of your plan’s limit. Unused allowances
                and credits expire and are not transferrable from month to month.
                <br>
                <br>Payment of your WestFax account balance is due and payable according to
                your plan for the Services you choose to use. All FaxForward Service is
                due on the 1st of each month and is payable by credit card at such time.
                If your WestFax Broadcast Fax Service is not paid by credit card and instead
                a qualified business account is approved by WestFax for corporate billing,
                charges will be accumulated, identified by account number and invoiced
                accordingly. Charges for qualified business accounts for Broadcast Fax
                Service are subject to the Terms. Any failure to pay the charges is violation
                of this Agreement and grounds for termination of your account by WestFax.
                <br>
                <br>If the payment method for your WestFax account is by credit card and payment
                is not received by WestFax from the card issuer or its agents, you agree
                to pay all amounts due upon demand by WestFax each time you use WestFax
                Services or allow or cause WestFax Services to be used. You agree and reaffirm
                that WestFax is authorized to charge your designated card. Your card issuer’s
                agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with WestFax
                Services, and you must refer to such agreement (not this Agreement) with
                respect to your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.
                <br>
                <br>You agree that WestFax may submit charges for your usage fees and recurring
                monthly and any other subscription fee without further authorization from
                you, until you provide prior notice (in accordance with WestFax’ verification
                procedures, as may be established by WestFax from time to time in its discretion)
                that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your designated
                card. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before WestFax reasonably
                could act on your notice. If you have any question regarding any charges
                that have been applied to your account, you must contact WestFax’ Customer
                Service within thirty (30) days of the charge date. Failure to do so will
                waive your ability to dispute such charges. Failure to use your account
                will not be deemed a basis for refusing to pay any charges submitted by
                WestFax in accordance with this Agreement.
                <br>
                <br>WestFax may amend the pricing, charges and other features of the Services
                at any time either by posting the amendments and changes on the Site, or
                by sending information regarding the amendments and changes to the email
                address you provided. You are responsible for regularly reviewing such
                amendments and changes including pricing information. Continued use of
                the Services, or non-termination of your account after changes are either
                posted or emailed to you constitutes your acceptance of the Services as
                modified.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="text-muted">The receipt and transmission of telemarketing phone calls, unsolicited
                fax advertisements, emails and text messages are regulated in the United
                States under the Sales Rule, the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection
                Act, Junk Fax Prevention Act and the CAN-SPAM Act. Any violation, including
                unsolicited marketing in violation of such laws, through the use of Services
                is prohibited and a violation of this Agreement. If you are receiving telemarketing
                phone calls, unsolicited fax advertisements, emails and texts, and if the
                telephone call, fax, email or text contains a telephone number, fax number,
                email address or other contact information to “unsubscribe” from receipt
                of additional calls, faxes, emails and texts, you may contact them. These
                opt-out mechanisms are required to be offered to the recipient in accordance
                to the Junk Fax Prevention Act and other applicable federal and state laws.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">This Agreement has been made solely for the benefit of WestFax and the
                Customer, and their particular successors and allowed assigns. Nothing
                in this Agreement is intended to bestow any rights/remedies under or by
                reason of this Agreement on any third party.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Governing Law and Jurisdiction

        <li>Termination

                existing procedures. Calling WestFax and terminating your plan or account
                must be complied with before your termination is effective. WestFax will
                notify you of the effective date of termination.
                <br>
                <br>WestFax shall have no responsibility to notify any third party, including
                any third party providers of services, merchandise or information, of any

                or other content in your account or forward any unread or unsent message,
                information or other content in your account to you or any third party.
                Any termination of your account shall not relieve you from any amounts
                owing or any other liability accruing under this Agreement prior to the
                time that such termination becomes effective.</p>

                at any other time. WestFax reserves the right to assign, transfer or delegate

                with state and federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy
                Act 18 U.S.C. Section 2701 et seq., ALL requests to WestFax for documents

                <br>All subpoenas must be served on WestFax, Inc. at 6565 South Dayton Street
                Suite 2350 Greenwood Village, CO 80111 prior to any response. Certified
                mail constitutes a method of service. WestFax reserves the right to request
                a copy of the complaint and any supporting documentation that demonstrates
                how the requested documents and information relate to the litigation. Upon
                receipt of a valid subpoena, WestFax may notify the customer whose documents
                and information is sought and allow the customer a reasonable period of
                time to move to quash the subpoena or otherwise respond.
                <br>
                <br>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act prohibits WestFax from disclosing
                the content of electronic communications pursuant to a civil subpoena.
                To obtain such content you may wish to contact or serve the customer who
                has custody and control of such documents and information relating to the
                account.
                <br>
                <br>Subject to the above, upon receipt of such a request, WestFax will conduct
                a search for documents and information accessible on its system that are
                responsive to the request. WestFax only keeps customers’ documents and
                information for a limited period of time. After the search is complete,
                WestFax will send the person requesting the documents and information the
                results of the search. WestFax reserves the right to send the results of
                the search to its customer who may then be compelled to produce them to
                person requesting the documents and information. To the extent any document
                located during the search process contains information restricted by law,
                exceeds the scope of the written request or is otherwise not subject to
                production, it will be redacted or removed.
                <br>
                <br>WestFax will require a minimum $250.00 reimbursement for the reasonable
                costs incurred in processing written requests and responding to subpoenas
                for documents and information. Checks should be made payable to WestFax,
                Inc. WestFax reserves the right to object to any written requests or subpoenas
                that are vague, overly broad or involve an undue burden. WestFax objects
                and exercises and retains its rights by objecting to any information it
                does have to provide.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">The <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/tcpa.html">Junk Fax Protection Act</a> provides
                that the sender of a facsimile is solely responsible for opt-out notice
                compliance and solely liable for any violations. A Customer may, however,
                voluntarily elect to retain a third party to accept opt out requests. This
                is an ancillary service offered by WestFax, is done automatically and is
                free of charge. The Junk Fax Protection Act provides that the third party
                need only accept and forward do-not-fax requests and is not advising, involved,
                responsible or liable to the Customer or any other party for such services.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="text-muted">WestFax has the right to disclose your email address to the owner of the
                website domain associated with your email address in order to monitor compliance

                the Service by giving five (5) days prior written notice of its intention
                to conduct such an audit at your facilities during normal business hours.
                If, in its sole discretion WestFax determines that you have violated the
                limitations on the Services, Westfax may immediately terminate or suspend
                your Services. You agree to pay WestFax the amount you would have been
                required to pay for the Services during the period of your non-compliance
                with the Services limitations and the cost of conducting any audit.</p>
