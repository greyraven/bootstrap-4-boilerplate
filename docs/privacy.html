                        to using or disclosing any information on the site. The FTC’s web site

        <li> <strong>Information Utilization</strong>

            <p class="text-muted pt-2">WestFax provides a medium for the distribution and receipt of its user’s
                fax, voice and email communications. Therefore, we will not monitor, edit,
                or disclose the contents of a user’s private communications unless WestFax
                in good faith believes that such action is necessary to: abide by law or
                comply with legal process served on WestFax; defend and protect the property
                or rights of WestFax; or act under circumstances to protect the personal
                safety of its users or the public. Users should also be aware (and therefore
                agree) that certain technical processing of and access to fax, voice and
                email messages and their content may be required for: message routing;
                conforming to connecting networks’ technical requirements; avoiding disruptions
                to WestFax’s services; or conforming to similar requirements.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">WestFax will not divulge to third parties the phone numbers, fax numbers,
                email addresses or any other information uploaded to our web site by our
                users for the purpose of using WestFax services or products unless WestFax

                    <br>
                    <p class="text-muted">We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services
                        and to address issues relating to their accounts. We reply by email or
                        phone.</p>

                <li> <strong>Referral Services</strong> 
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-muted">WestFax offers referral services, asking a user to inform a friend about
                        our service. We collect the name and email address of the friend, and offer
                        the invitation to the friend. WestFax stores this information for the sole
                        purpose of contacting the friend and tracking the success of this referral
                        program.</p>

                <li> <strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong> 
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-muted">We make every effort to preserve user privacy. We may need to disclose
                        personal information when required by law or when we have a reasonable
                        belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with a current judicial
                        proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us. For example, WestFax
                        may disclose personal information to law enforcement, other government
                        officials, or third parties in response to criminal or civil subpoenas.
                        Sometimes, these requests come from our third party internet, telecommunications
                        and service providers all over the world who supply the network required
                        for us to deliver our services. In order to maintain the integrity of our
                        network, we often cooperate with requests from these third party providers
                        and/or requests from law enforcement or other governmental officials directed
                        to these providers.</p>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Third Parties</strong> 
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-muted">We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods
                        and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally
                        identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Business Transitions</strong> 
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-muted">In the event WestFax goes through a business transition, such as an acquisition
                        by another company, a merger, or selling a portion of its assets, in most
                        instances, users’ personal information will be part of the assets transferred.
                        Users will be notified prior to a change of ownership or control of their
                        personal information. As a result, if in the business transition the users’
                        personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different
                        from that stated at the time of collection they will be given a choice
                        not to have their information used in this different manner.</p>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Spam and Junk Faxes</strong> 
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-muted">WestFax does not share your email address or fax number. While we cannot
                        be responsible for external communications received through WestFax Services,
                        if we are given notice that a WestFax Service is being used for spam or
                        junk faxes, then we will deactivate that client. You may report a junk
                        fax by calling WestFax Customer Care at 800-473-6208.</p>

        <li> <strong>Protection, Misuse, Alteration or Loss of Information</strong>

            <p
            class="text-muted">WestFax takes precaution to protect its user’s information. Their information
                is protected both online and offline when users submit information via
                WestFax’ web site. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is utilized
                to enhance the security of the users information on WestFax’s web site.
                The user can tell that the page is secure by looking for the web address
                to begin with https (instead of http) and a padlock on the status bar.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong>Secure Sockets Layer</strong> 
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-muted">When our web site asks users to enter personal identity and other information
                            (such as credit card number), that information is 128-bit encrypted and
                            is protected with encryption software customarily used in the industry
                            – Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL applies encryption between two communicating

                        <p class="text-muted">We will store your personal transmissions on our servers for a limited
                            time and will endeavor to purge old transmissions from our servers when
                            the expiration period has run out (approximately sixty (60) days). We use
                            industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your transmissions
                            (as well as your personally identifiable information), such as firewalls
                            and SSL technology. These are the same technologies that most web sites
                            use to safeguard credit card information and other personal information.

                        <p class="text-muted">The time period we keep your information varies according to what the
                            information is used for. In some cases, there may be legal requirements

                            no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the information

            <p class="text-muted">If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code,
                phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires to use
                our Service, we provide ways to correct, update, or deactivate users’ personally

                <li> <strong>Change Notification</strong> 
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-muted">If WestFax decides to change its privacy policy, WestFax will post those
                        changes in this privacy statement so users are always aware of what information
                        is collected, how it is used, and under what circumstances it may be disclosed.
                        WestFax will notify users if we are going to utilize users’ personally
                        identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the
                        time of collection. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use
                        their information in this new manner. However, if users have opted out
                        of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account,
                        then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be
                        used in this new manner. In addition, if WestFax makes any material changes
                        in its privacy practices that do not affect user information, WestFax will
                        post a notice on the web site notifying users of the change.</p>

        <li> <strong>Requests for Documents and Information</strong>

            <p class="text-muted">In order to protect the privacy interests of its customers and to comply
                with state and federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy
                Act 18 U.S.C. Section 2701 et seq., ALL requests to Westfax for documents
                and information relating to its customers must be made in writing and include
                the express written consent of the customer or be made pursuant to a civil
                subpoena validly issued by a court having valid and proper jurisdiction
                over the matter and properly served upon Westfax.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">A form of consent is accessible at:
                <br> <a href="https://westfax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/AuthorizationToProduceDocumentationAndRecords.pdf">https://westfax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/AuthorizationToProduceDocumentationAndRecords.pdf</a>

            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">Westfax reserves the right to request a copy of the complaint and any
                supporting documentation that demonstrates how the requested documents
                and information relate to the litigation. Upon receipt of a valid subpoena,
                Westfax may notify the customer whose documents and information is sought
                and allow the customer a reasonable period of time to move to quash the
                subpoena.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">The Electronic Communications Privacy Act prohibits Westfax from disclosing
                the content of electronic communications pursuant to a civil subpoena.
                To obtain such content you may wish to contact or serve the customer who
                has custody and control of such documents and information relating to the
                account.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Subject to the above, upon receipt of such a request, Westfax will conduct
                a search for documents and information accessible on its system that are
                responsive to the request. Westfax only keeps customers’ documents and
                information for a limited period of time. After the search is complete,
                Westfax will send the person requesting the documents and information the
                results of the search. Westfax reserves the right to send the results of
                the search to its customer who may then be compelled to produce them to
                person requesting the documents and information. To the extent any document
                located during the search process contains information restricted by law,
                exceeds the scope of the written request or is otherwise not subject to
                production, it will be redacted or removed.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Westfax will require a minimum $250.00 reimbursement for the reasonable
                costs incurred in processing written requests and responding to subpoenas
                for documents and information. Checks should be made payable to Westfax,
                Inc. Westfax reserves the right to object to any written requests or subpoenas
                that are vague, overly broad or involve an undue burden. By responding,
                Westfax is not waiving any objection it may have relating to this matter.</p>
